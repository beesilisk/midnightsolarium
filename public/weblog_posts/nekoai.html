         <p>Check out that URL! If you’re reading this weblog around the time it was posted, it probably says “midnightsolarium.neocities.org”, but there’s a chance you’re viewing the <strong>nekoweb</strong> version instead!</p>
         <p>I maaaay have said there was gonna be an explanation for why I chose to mirror this site, so hooray for me holding myself to my word (and also for posting 2 weblogs within 1 month. truly my work ethic cannot be bested).</p>
         <h3>showing up late to the meeting while holding a cup of coffee</h3>
         <p>I’m around several weeks late to this party, so I’m sure I missed my opportunity to add anything new to the conversation. But talking about it is necessary for context, so apologies for being irrelevant. It will happen again.</p>
         <p>To quickly summarize: back in June 2023, the creator of Neocities wrote a <a href="https://kyledrake.com/writings/ai" alt="kyle drake's AI statement" title="kyle drake's AI statement">statement<img src="../img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"></a> broadly defending AI and dismissing some of its criticisms. Then in 2024, an AI was added to the site’s code editor. As of writing this weblog, the AI is not easily accessible, but the fact that it’s in Neocities’ code indicates there are plans to fully implement it in the future.</p>
         <p>In October, Kyle’s statement started circulating within the Neocities community (or at least the parts of the community that I follow). I’m not sure what prompted the resurgence, but people were pissed. Because of the statement or the AI or both, people started mirroring their site on Nekoweb in protest, or <em>leaving Neocities altogether</em>. A lot of the people who stayed were still vocal about their disapproval.</p>
         <p>Not me though. I was. Busy. Mostly with boring real life stuff. You know how it is. Also, I’m not usually the type to involve myself in online discourse, even when it involves a topic I care about. Saves me a lot of headaches.</p>
         <p>But I didn’t outright ignore everything going on. I finally took the time to read Kyle Drake’s statement; I read peoples’ opinions on the subject; I signed the <a href="https://ai-petition.neocities.org/" alt="neocities AI petition" title="neocities AI petition">petition<img src="../img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"></a> calling for the removal of the AI assistant. And when initial wave of anger died down on the internet, the topic remained festering at the back of my mind. </p>
         <p>So I guess I’m finally talking about it.</p>
         <h3>Kyle Drake doesn’t understand the criticism against AI</h3>
         <p>(If you only care about the changes being made to midnight solarium, <em>you can skip this entire section</em>. Most of this is just me griping.)</p>
         <p>Because I value both my time and my sanity, I’m not going to deep dive into my opinions regarding AI, or debunk Kyle’s statement line-for-line. But to keep things relevant to the subject at hand, I will say that <strong>I consider AI to be a pest</strong> within tech services, constantly showing up where it isn’t needed or wanted. Occasionally there are AI features that are genuinely useful (like those cancer screenings Kyle brought up), but most implementations are lazy and disjointed and make the overall product functionally worse for end-users.</p>
         <p>I don’t love the idea of an AI being used to make Neocities sites. I can’t imagine using it to build midnight solarium, even with all its current flaws, because it would defeat the entire purpose of a personal website.</p>
         <p>But hey, at least this AI seems to be an optional feature. And so far Kyle hasn’t said or done anything to indicate that Neocities sites will be used to train AI, though he hasn’t assuaged those fears either. It probably seems like I’m giving undeserved credit, but, well, the bar is on the floor when it comes to online services. <em>Neocities still meets my ever-lowering standards</em>, which probably says more about the tech industry than anything else.</p>
         <p>I probably wouldn’t be leaving Neocities if it weren’t for Kyle’s statement. When I stop and think about it, it’s actually kind of amazing how a ~1000-word mini-essay managed to eviscerate my already-weakened trust in a product. Kyle, I know you’re not reading this, but if you’re gonna keep supporting AI, consider hiring a <span class="tooltip">PR specialist</span><span class="tooltiptext">I’m not saying my own communication skills are any better. The difference is that midnight solarium doesn’t have a paid subscription tier</span>.</p>
         <p>I mean, buddy. Dude. Pal. I get that generative AI has become a hot button issue. There are a lot of uninformed opinions and hyperbolic doomer takes going around, and I understand how those with a deeper understanding of the technology were growing frustrated in 2023, never mind now. But portraying every AI critic as a technophobic pearl-clutcher requires the sort of ignorance that comes from living in a pressure-locked echo chamber.</p>
         <p>Either that, or the <strong>willful ignorance</strong> of a person who went into tech hoping for an easy 6-figure salary that turned out to not be so easy, and is now trying to force a new dot-com bubble into existence and crown themselves as innovators within a stale market. One who ignores every indication that their cash cow could have negative consequences because it’s easier to prioritize monetary gain and morally justify decisions retroactively.</p>
         <p>I’ve gotta give Kyle credit though: he and I both agree that the term “AI” sucks. I find that its vagueness makes discussions needlessly difficult. You criticize AI for its role in <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Automation%20and%20New%20Tasks%20-%20How%20Technology%20Displace.pdf" alt="Automation and New Tasks: How Technology Displaces and Reinstates Labor" title="Automation and New Tasks">labour displacement<img src="../img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"></a>, its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241123025828/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-computer-scientist-breaks-down-generative-ais-hefty-carbon-footprint/" alt="A Computer Scientist Breaks Down Generative AI’s Hefty Carbon Footprint" title="A Computer Scientist Breaks Down Generative AI’s Hefty Carbon Footprint">environmental impact<img src="../img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"></a>, or its general <a href="https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/assets/articlePDFs/v31/The-Artificial-Intelligence-Black-Box-and-the-Failure-of-Intent-and-Causation-Yavar-Bathaee.pdf" alt="The Artificial Intelligence Black Box and the Failure of Intent and Causation" title="The Artificial Intelligence Black Box and the Failure of Intent and Causation">lack of transparency<img src="../img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"></a>, and AI bros will call you a progress-hating Luddite who’s afraid of spellcheck and predictive analytics. Meanwhile, Kyle hates the term “AI” because – assuming I’m understanding his argument – he thinks saying “machine learning” is technically more accurate and will sound less scary to the masses. His AI sales pitch hinges on conflating disparate technologies and ignoring genuine concerns in favour of some strawman counterargument comparing ChatGPT to nuclear weapons.</p>
         <p>In case you’re not aware, sort of AI that’s hiding within Neocities’ text editor is not going to prevent a car crash. It’s not going to solve climate change, or treat your mental illness, or provide any sort of “societal empowerment”. besides create more boring websites for an internet full of boring websites.</p>
         <p>I don’t know if Kyle Drake is ignoring the negatives of AI because he intends to personally profit from it, or if he’s just another sucker who’s fallen for the hype. And I don’t really care. <strong>I’ve never met the guy</strong>, I almost certainly never will, and I’m not in the habit of psychoanalyzing people based on their online persona. But I’ve spent too much time in tech spaces to assume better out of people. And this is purely my subjective opinion, but I don’t expect people who love AI to make the smartest decisions about their product either way.</p>
         <h3>maybe I’m a hypocrite, because my loyalty can be bought and sold</h3>
         <p>Okay, so the guy who runs Neocities gives me the ick. <strong>So what?</strong> I’m not hung up on feeling virtuous to the point where I only use products made by people I could grab a beer with. We all know there is no ethical consumption under capitalism and whatnot. Disagreeing with someone’s opinions and disliking an optional feature seems like a petty reason to switch web hosts.</p>
         <p>Okay, it’s time to address the elephant in the room: <em>I have been a Supporter on Neocities</em> for the past several months. I pay around $7 CAD each month in exchange for several additional features. So far the only feature I’ve taken advantage of is CORS support, which lets me add widgets like a moon phase tracker and status.cafe feed, but isn’t strictly necessary to the site’s core functionality.</p>
         <p>I pay for the Supporter tier partially because I’m too lazy to use a <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/blog/neocities-external-widgets" alt="a workaround" title="PetraPixel's workaround">workaround<img src="../img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"></a> for embedding external widgets, but mostly because Neocities is a great resource! Yes, “great resource”; present tense. It’s a solid option for anyone looking for a free host for their static website, and has tons of <a href="https://neocities.org/tutorials" alt="Neocities official resources" title="Neocities official resources">official<img src="../img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"></a> and <a href="https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/learn/articles/beginners-guide-neocities" alt="sadgrl's beginners guide to neocities" title="sadgrl's beginners guide to neocities">unofficial<img src="../img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"></a> resources that make it accessible to absolute beginners. </p>
         <p>And, despite all my griping about Neocities’ AI implementations, I still trust it more than a Microsoft subsidiary like GitHub Pages. Nekoweb seems pretty solid but it’s also newer and less established than its competitors, so it’s difficult to give it a glowing endorsement. Other free web hosting options... exist. I don’t know enough about them to have an opinion.</p>
         <p>I don’t think being on Neocities is a bad decision. The site still does what it needs to do, and it does it well. If someone asked me if they should make a Neocities site, I would say yes. But now that I have a clearer understanding of Kyle Drake’s priorities for the site, <em>I am no longer comfortable with supporting Neocities financially.</em></p>
         <p><span style="font-size:12px;">(I’m not making any sort of moral judgment toward paying for the Supporter tier. I’m talking about my own personal comfort. Nothing else.)</span></p>
         <p>And, well. The only Supporter perk I was taking advantage of was the CORS support. Which Nekoweb offers for free. So.</p>
         <p>Unless some dramatic news comes out that would make Neocities the more appealing option, I plan on <strong>transitioning away from Neocities</strong> and eventually exclusively updating on Nekoweb. I don’t know how long I’ll keep updating on Neocities, but I’ll probably be here for the rest of the year. Depends on <span class="tooltip">how long</span><span class="tooltiptext">Considering how long it took me to write this “quick update” weblog, that might not happen until 2030. Hopefully sooner tho</span> it takes me to make a decent landing page so the Neocities site can redirect to the Nekoweb version.</p>
         <p>For most people, I doubt this change will matter at all. Unless you follow the site on Neocities, in which case you’ll stop seeing this site’s updates on your feed. Sorry about that. I swear someday I’ll make an RSS feed. I’m just. Very slow.</p>
         <h3>in the end, i only trust myself (and even that’s pretty iffy)</h3>
         <p>I realize that if my problem is a lack of trust toward web hosting services, jumping from Neocities to Nekoweb isn’t an ideal solution. I don’t know the people behind Nekoweb, and it’s pretty inevitable that they do something I don’t fully agree with.</p>
         <p>To tell the truth, neither Neocities nor Nekoweb are places I'd expect to call home indefinitely.</p>
         <p>When I decided to create midnight solarium, I knew that one of two things would happen:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>I’d try out webmastering for a while, decide it wasn’t for me, and abandon the hobby, OR</li>
          <li>I’d stick with it, and the site would <strong>eventually outgrow Neocities</strong></li>
         </ul>
         <p>Just swap out “Neocities” for “Nekoweb”, and my current expectations for this site remain more or less the same. That isn’t to say that I think using free hosting services like Neocities and Nekoweb are inherently less legitimate than other hosting options. If you’re getting everything you need out of them, there’s no rule saying you have to leave.</p>
         <p>My problem is that I have delusions of grandeur – or maybe I don’t know how to keep a hobby without diving into the deep end. Maybe I just keep underestimating the difficulty of any project that piques my interest.</p>
         <p>Y’see, even before I decided to create my own website, I had an interest in <em>learning how to host my own website</em>. Which probably says a lot about my disjointed priorities. And the sort of things I consider to be fun.</p>
         <p>But can you blame me? Clearly I have trust issues when it comes to third-party services. Even when a service does everything right, this website will still be at the mercy of someone else’s questionable decisions. I much prefer things to go wrong because of my own bad decisions, thank you very much.</p>
         <p><strong>Don’t expect me to start self-hosting anytime soon</strong> though. I’m not looking for excuses to spend money right now, and setting up a home web server is gonna cost money no matter how much FOSS and scrap hardware I utilize. I’m plan on moving soon, so if I decide to go all-in and manage the server locally rather than use a VPS, I imagine it’s best wait at least until I’m settled down before making drastic changes to my home network. Not to mention my life’s currently stressful enough without having to figure out web server administration on the fly.</p>
         <p>And of course, there’s the fact that it takes me forever to get around to doing things even at the best of times. But someday! Maybe! Ask me again in a year or too, because no matter what happens with these web hosts, I’ve become too emotionally invested in midnight solarium to abandon it.</p>
         <h3>tl;dr</h3>
         <p>the guy who runs neocities is offputting and nekoweb offers more features for cheaper, so midnight solarium is moving to nekoweb within the next few months. for now both versions of the site will be updated in tandem, but eventually the neocities site will have a landing page that redirects to the nekoweb-hosted site. this shouldn’t affect anyone on neocities, aside from the fact that updates will eventually start showing up on your activity feed. sorry about that. someday i hope to switch to self-hosting, but that would be a huge undertaking and I’m not in a position to deal with that right now</p>
         <p>Or, if even my summaries are too long-winded: <strong>midnight solarium is moving to nekoweb!</strong></p>
         <br /><br />
         <p>Oh, and in case you’re interested, here’s the petition for removing Neocities’ present and future AI: </p>
