       <article>
        <p>I&rsquo;m gonna start off this rant with a warning: I am going to offhandedly allude to a lot of creepypastas that may be unfamiliar to you. A lot of <strong>bad creepypastas</strong>, to be clear. If you don&rsquo;t know most of them, you are making better use of your limited time on this earth than me and you should keep up the excellent work by NOT looking up every reference I make.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That said, it helps to be familiar with the man/man-eating-monster of the hour, <a href="https://creepypastaclassics.fandom.com/wiki/Eyeless_Jack" title="Eyeless Jack">Eyeless Jack</a><img src="blog_img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;">.</p>
        <p>You might also want to know about <a href="https://creepypastaclassics.fandom.com/wiki/Jeff_the_Killer" title="Jeff the Killer">Jeff the Killer</a><img src="blog_img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;">, since I&rsquo;ll be <span class="tooltip">comparing</span><span class="tooltiptext">And as a warning for how this is gonna go: Jeff the Killer is my example of a <strong>better</strong> creepypasta. God help us all.</span> those two creepypastas a lot. I assume that anyone far enough down the niche internet rabbit hole to find my obscure website would definitely know the most infamous creepypasta of all time, but I suppose you could be a concerned parent trying to understand your child&rsquo;s interests. If so, please make sure your kid touches grass or they&rsquo;ll end up like me.</p>
        <p>You can also read some actual good literature if you want, but only after we&rsquo;ve had this long-awaited discussion. Escapism is all well and good in moderation, but right now we need to talk about important matters. We need to talk about Eyeless Jack.</p>
        <p>Because I don&rsquo;t think I fully understand why anyone liked that creepypasta. I certainly don&rsquo;t know why it became ubiquitous within the younger fandom. Sure, it certainly wasn&rsquo;t beloved among the adult creepypasta fans who tried very hard to insist that creepypasta was badass and not at all catered to the fears/interests of 12-year-olds, but if you were the kind of person who lacked shame (or was one of those 12-year-olds) then you knew who Eyeless Jack was and probably drew fanart of him being tenderly embraced by a murderous clown whose name is also Jack. That&rsquo;s right, I see you and I know your sins.</p>
        <p>Not that my knowledge comes from personal experience! Nuh-uh, no way. Contrary to whatever quite frankly ridiculous assumptions you&rsquo;re currently making about my character, I was never the sort of creepypasta kid who turned The Horrors into my <span class="tooltip">woobified blorbos</span><span class="tooltiptext">for the aforementioned concerned parent reading this: this is the highest honor your child will grant to a fictional character</span> - because I was much too old and mature by the time that side of the fandom hit peak popularity.</p>
        <p>Still, I was close enough to that crowd that I feel like I understand some of the appeal of the fandom. Of course tweens and teens latched onto fiction that&rsquo;s <strong>both dark and easily accessible</strong>. Of course the sky is blue. I&rsquo;m not gonna waste your time by pretending to be scandalized.</p>
        <p>But I've got to be so real with you: I have no idea how most creepypastas managed to bubble up from the depths of obscurity into &ldquo;hanging out in Slenderman&rsquo;s mansion&rdquo; levels of popularity. You&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d have some sort of insight given the <span class="tooltip">permanently brainrotting</span><span class="tooltiptext">but, like, totally cool and not cringe creepypastas! it&rsquo;s different!</span> volume of creepypastas I read as a kid in order to get around the &ldquo;no horror allowed&rdquo; rule my parents unfairly inflicted upon me in a vain attempt to counteract whatever was clearly wrong with my brain chemistry. Maybe a lifetime of mindlessly gorging on gory mythos made by similarly unwell individuals has destroyed whatever part of my brain could allow me to comprehend the very fandom that caused my unraveling.</p>
        <p>But Eyeless Jack? He vexes me the most out of any of them. There are so many creepypastas that are, by the standards of anyone capable of critical thought, shit. But the Eyeless Jack creepypasta gives me less than shit. It gives me <strong>nothing at all</strong>.</p>
        <p>I guess there&rsquo;s a plot. Technically. The POV character wakes up one morning and discovers he&rsquo;s missing his kidneys. The next night he wakes up and sees a man in a blue mask standing over him. He flees the house and returns the next day to discover his brother&rsquo;s corpse as well as a half-eaten kidney. I&rsquo;m summarizing, but only barely. <strong>Almost nothing happens</strong> in the story, and it doesn&rsquo;t help that pretty much every plot detail is glossed over. Forgive me for baseless theorizing, but I assume the writer was rushing to the point where they could physically describe the cool monster boy they came up with - but even that section ends up feeling rushed due to the fact that Eyeless Jack looks like a Halloween costume so lazy that a perfect cosplay would probably get you laughed out of any contest. For a story about cannibalism, it is sorely lacking any meat to chew on.</p>
        <p>This is a bit of a sidenote, but I want to give some perspective: the creepypasta is less than 600 words long. The Jeff the Killer creepypasta makes it to a respectable 4291 words. The full Man Door Hand Hook Car Door trollpasta made it all the way up to 164 words, over a third of the length of this completely sincere creepypasta. Even this weblog is over 3x longer than the creepypasta it&rsquo;s about, and I haven&rsquo;t been able to write a coherent sentence since I went off my meds against the wishes of <span class="tooltip">my psychiatrist</span><span class="tooltiptext">That was a joke. Clearly I don&rsquo;t have a psychiatrist.</span>. I get that it isn&rsquo;t the size that matters, it&rsquo;s how you use it, but I&rsquo;ve already made myself clear about Eyeless Jack&rsquo;s performance.</p>
        <p>I can at least understand why Jeff the Killer got turned into an edgy teen heartthrob. I do find it hilarious that the creepy picture that came packaged with the story looks nothing like the sexy emo twink in all his fanart, despite the fact that the original <span class="tooltip">unsexy</span><span class="tooltiptext">i know what you monsterfuckers are gonna come out of the woodwork to say. Don&rsquo;t bother. We&rsquo;re talking about what 13-year-old girls find attractive. Not everything is about you.</span> picture is the only genuinely scary thing about that story and probably the only reason it got popular at all.</p>
        <p>Eyeless Jack is barely more than an empty Word document. He has no backstory, no personality, not even a hint of mystery to encourage speculation. And unlike Jeff the Killer, the character design provided by the accompanying picture isn&rsquo;t the metaphorical kid who does 95% of the group project. He&rsquo;s just some guy in dark clothes and a featureless mask. A bit unsettling in a way that feels reminiscent of classic grey aliens, but that similarity also makes the design feel derivative.</p>
        <p>Whenever I see a lineup of all the popular fandomified creepypasta villains/protagonists, Eyeless Jack <strong>tends to feel like a background character</strong> meant to fill out the crowd. Especially when he&rsquo;s standing next to the late additions to the popular lineup - most of them obviously started off as someone&rsquo;s cool creepypasta OC that got adopted by the broader fandom. (I have no way of proving the intentions of those stories&rsquo; authors, but&hellip; have you read them? Recently? They&rsquo;re not stories about a scary monster, they&rsquo;re about troubled teens who snap and become the Joker and have an oddly specific gimmick setting them apart from all the other Joker Mode teen OCs cropping up on DeviantArt.)</p>
        <p>So why the fuck did anyone pay attention to Eyeless Jack?</p>
        <p>Wait, why the fuck am <strong>I</strong> paying attention to Eyeless Jack?</p>
        <p>It seems that Eyeless Jack&rsquo;s popularity makes no sense if you judge the story by the same qualities you would for most forms of media, but creepypasta isn&rsquo;t most forms of media. This becomes obvious if you take a moment to think back on a creepypasta you haven&rsquo;t revisited in over 10 years. Do you remember the way the story was told? The slow reveals? The vivid descriptions of whatever monster was meant to haunt your nightmares. You probably answered &lsquo;yes&rsquo; if you were thinking about the rare genuinely good stories, but that creepypasta probably never had a dedicated PMV full of uncredited fanart set to the nightcore version of Monster by Skillet. If we want to understand the popularity of Eyeless Jack, we need to accept that the subgenre of DeviantArt creepypasta cannot be critiqued by standard literary criteria.</p>
        <p>Oh, what a fool I have made of myself! The answer was staring me right in the face. Didn&rsquo;t I just say that later creepypasta OCs all had an oddly specific gimmick? Why would anyone bother developing a gimmick that makes their character stand apart when very few people cared about, I dunno, the quality of the writing. It&rsquo;s because <strong>the hook is everything that matters</strong>.</p>
        <p>And would you look at that; Eyeless Jack has 3 distinct hooks:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>He has no eyes.</li>
        <li>He eats your kidneys.</li>
        <li>He has a featureless blue mask???? Seems counterproductive to eating kidneys but I suppose fashion isn&rsquo;t meant to be practical.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these hooks are extremely simple, but combining them into a single character makes him unique enough to be distinctive, but not so unique that he feels like a main character. He&rsquo;s the sort of character that isn&rsquo;t anyone&rsquo;s favourite, but has enough going on that you won&rsquo;t mind if someone ships him with your actual favourite.</p>
        <p>And yes, his <strong>shipping potential is deeply important</strong> to his popularity. Creepypasta characters in this corner of the fandom could not exist in a bubble. They were designed to be part of an ensemble cast - even when the original authors had no idea their creations would be part of some serial killer sitcom. The author of Eyeless Jack unintentionally made a character perfect for fanworks - more so than the later creepypasta OCs that were clearly designed to be invited to Slenderman&rsquo;s mansion, because kids are dumb and I&rsquo;m smart and that&rsquo;s why I <span class="tooltip">figured out the art</span><span class="tooltiptext">please ignore the fact that I figured this out about a decade after creepypastas lost relevance. i am still very smart and cool</span> of creating the perfect creepypasta hook.</p>
        <p>If a character made for a good fit within the ensemble, then the fandom would drag that character out of whatever garbage bin or a story they came from and adopt them into the most unmarketable shared horror universe since that 2004 Van Helsing movie.</p>
        <p>There&rsquo;s a lot to criticize about the &ldquo;serial killer found family&rdquo; side of the creepypasta fandom (most of which I am sidestepping because you clearly haven&rsquo;t been paying attention if you think this weblog is a 100% serious fandom retrospective), but I have some respect for their decision to prioritize characters that would work off of each other rather than characters from stories that are, y&rsquo;know, good. Arguably this was purely due to collective questionable taste, but I still admire their <strong>lack of interest in even appearing high-brow</strong>. As someone who spent their teenage years hiding half their special interests in an effort to seem mature, I find myself envious of those kids&rsquo; audacity.</p>
        <p>If I&rsquo;m being honest, I&rsquo;m kinda embarrassed that it took me this long to understand Eyeless Jack&rsquo;s popularity. Maybe the truth was obfuscated by my need to position myself above a work of fiction that falls short of the refined taste in media I pretend to have.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>.....</p>
        <p>.......fuck it.</p>
        <p>I love Eyeless Jack. He&rsquo;s one of those guys who is obviously not making any effort to be cool, and doesn&rsquo;t even care that his aloofness automatically makes him cool. If I had to kiss one creepypasta villain on the mouth, I would strongly consider Eyeless Jack - even though to love him would require tolerating the taste of human entrails - because he&rsquo;s simple and down-to-earth and quite frankly my life can&rsquo;t handle the extra baggage that all those other creepypastas are bringing to the table. Eyeless Jack is husband material.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And you know what? I take back my criticism about his design being boring. It <strong>is</strong> boring, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, but at least it&rsquo;s simple for amateur artists to draw. Maybe the reason I never rotated his boyfriend Laughing Jack in my head had nothing to do with his story&rsquo;s quality and everything to do with <strong>literally not being able to rotate him in my head</strong> despite my borderline hyperphantasia.</p>
        <p>And now that I&rsquo;m being honest about the fact that I started this weblog with a string of lies, I might as well also say that if you&rsquo;re looking for something to do this Halloween (and if you&rsquo;ve read this far, you probably still have time to kill), go read some of those iconic creepypastas you haven&rsquo;t thought about in years. So many of them are the specific brand of id-driven absurdity you find when the author is deeply passionate and deeply lacking in self-awareness, and that uncritical sincerity often creates a more frightening reflection of the human psyche than half the elevated horror movies that get recommended to me.</p>
        <p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll dig up and read your old Eyeless Jack x Jeff the Killer fanfic too. The night is still young.</p>
