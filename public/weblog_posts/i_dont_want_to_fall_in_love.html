          <p>I’m posting this on the first full week after Valentine’s Day. My goal here is to get something off my chest, but my timing has turned out to be significant.</p>
          <p>You see, I’ve spent most of my Valentine’s Days single.</p>
          <p>People used to console me about it. They tried to be subtle about the fact that they were consoling me, not wanting to outright say that being single is shameful, but their pity was easily inferred. You don’t try to rebrand a romantic holiday as one that applies to all forms of love unless you feel like you’ve got something to prove. It always felt a little patronizing to me, but I knew it came from a good place, so I never complained.</p>
          <p>Not that I can complain about it anymore. At this point I’ve spent enough Valentine’s Days single that people have realized I’m not some temporarily embarrassed romantic. They’re are raising eyebrows and asking subtly prying questions and recommending dating apps without prompting. I hear stories about how you have to keep trying to find ~the one~ because the alternative is being sad and alone forever. I am often told, unprompted, that there’s no shame in seeing a therapist, though I never implied otherwise.</p>
          <p>I’m not usually the type of single person who hates Valentine’s Day. If other people enjoy being in a relationship and want to celebrate their love, then I’m happy they’re happy. I typically spend the day distantly glad for others, and moderately annoyed by its excessive commercialization, but until recently, it has always been just another day for me.</p>
          <p>I might be a couple days too late for this announcement, but on the off chance that someone reading this knows me personally and is concerned about my relationship status: I am <strong>fine</strong>. I am happy being single. Because I don’t want to be in a relationship. I don’t want to be in love. Ever.</p>
          <p>In fact, it might be because of the increasing pressure to correct my current lifestyle that this recent Valentine’s Day left me with a sense of dread.</p>
          <p>I haven’t been single for every Valentine’s Day. I’ve had relationships in the past, and I remember them fondly when I think about the times that weren’t overtly romantic. I know I’m lucky – despite generally being a poor judge of character, I’ve only ever dated good people. I enjoyed being close to them in ways most platonic friendships don’t often allow, but their good looks and charming personality never made me want to stick my tongue in their mouth. Or ask them to move in with me. Or let them share my last name.</p>
          <p>Dating is fun in all the ways friendship used to be fun. As I grow older, it’s becoming clear that the people around me do not consider non-romantic forms of love to be fulfilling and meaningful on its own. More of my adult friendships seem to be better resemble casual acquaintanceships, or honorary family. It’s a startling reversal of the norms from my childhood, when friendships were bigger commitments than dating and often more sincere than our assigned family units. Then everyone flipped their priorities while I wasn’t looking. I still have some valuable friendships, but sometimes I consider searching for other types of relationships just to come close to filling the void. Even though I know dating wouldn’t actually satisfy me, and would probably just leave me feeling miserable.</p>
          <p>For a while I wasn’t sure why Valentine’s Day was starting to make me feel uneasy, but I think I’ve figured it out. I’m scared that I’ll never form a close relationship without one of us leaving the other unsatisfied – either they will settle for receiving less from me and spend their life unsatisfied, or I will give more of myself away than I’m comfortable sacrificing until every moment together feels subtly violating.</p>
          <p>I’m aware those aren’t necessarily the only options in a relationship. There’s always a chance that I’ll meet someone who wants exactly what I want in a relationship, and neither of us will be forced to compromise on our own happiness. But I don’t think it’s realistic to spend my time searching for <em>the one</em>. And even if I did find someone who wants to be close to me but not share a life with me, figuring out the exact balance of almost-but-not-quite-romance that works might be more trouble than it’s worth. </p>
          <p>So I really hope I never fall in love. I’d rather spend my time and energy being happy instead.</p>
          <p>Anyway, happy Aromantic Spectrum Awareness Week.</p>
