          <p>This weblog discusses topics that may be triggering to some people.</p>
          <p>I'll be talking about creepypastas containing a wide variety of sensitive content. I've included links to each, so please keep that in mind if you choose to read them yourself.</p>
          <p>Stay safe, and Happy Halloween (`꒳´)♡</p>
        </div>

          <p>Lately I’ve been revisiting a lot of old creepypastas that I either remember or half-remember reading as a kid. I can’t give a good reason why I’ve done this other than the sudden overwhelming fits of nostalgia that overwhelm my thoughts from time to time. It’s a very serious condition.</p>
          <p>I’ve selected a small handful of creepypastas so I can inspect them with a level of scrutiny that they were never designed to face. I tried to choose ones with varying degrees of quality as well as overall popularity. Hopefully rambling about them will remove whichever brainworms have infected my grey matter.</p>
          <h3>XoRax</h3>
          <p>If you don’t remember which creepypasta this is, <strong>don’t panic</strong>. Everyone forgot about this one except for me.</p>
          <p><a href="https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/XoRax" title="XoRax">XoRax</a><img src="blog_img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"> has a post-apocalyptic setting with a twist ending you’ll either love or hate. And since a lot of what makes this story interesting revolves around the twist, I’ll be talking about it somewhat vaguely, but you should still consider this a spoiler warning. </p>
          <p>Depending on your tolerance level for creepypasta nonsense, you might hate its use of some oft-derived tropes. I’m talking stuff like “that innocent story from your childhood was actually super dark this whole time!” and “the whole story was just in somebody’s head!” that were painfully common in old creepypastas.</p>
          <p>That warning might remind you of some more popular fan theory-type creepypastas like The Rugrats Theory or Ash’s Coma – stories that are looked down on nowadays for being over-the-top grimdark angstfests – but I find XoRax to be a lot more bearable in comparison. Its use of these tropes lends the creepypasta a significant level of corniness, sure, but I find that its decision to hide these tropes until the end makes it a fun reveal that doesn’t try to affect your perception of the source material so much as use it as inspiration. The ending might make you roll your eyes, but it won’t piss you off. </p>
          <p>If nothing else, I consider XoRax to be an interesting case study on how the way a story is structured can <em>reframe its use of cliches</em>, even if those cliches aren’t directly subverted. It’s not the best creepypasta, but it’s possibly the best executed of its kind.</p>
          <h3>A Strange Night in the City of Angels</h3>
          <p>I swear I’m not trying to neg these creepypastas! The internet already has enough retrospectives which basically boil down to “these stories were bad and cringe” and I like to think I’m better than that. So lets talk about a story I unironically enjoy.</p>
          <p><a href="https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/A_Strange_Night_in_the_City_of_Angels" title="A Strange Night in the City of Angels">A Strange Night in the City of Angels</a><img src="blog_img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"> follows a former WWII medic turned bartender who makes conversation with an increasingly unusual bar patron. And that’s pretty much it. This story doesn’t rely on the expected melodrama or shallow gimmicks. There’s no iconic moment that’ll haunt your nightmares or one-liner to make it stand out from the crowd. The story is told in an almost drowsy manner, like a late-night conversation that’s only half-remember by next morning. Even as supernatural elements are made apparent, the reader is only given a brief glimpse of it while the majority of the focus remains on its themes of guilt and post-war trauma.</p>
          <p>Despite being writtin in 2012, this creepypasta feels a lot more modern. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, creepypastas almost always conformed to an unspoken house style. They were <strong>short, blunt, and came with an obvious hook</strong> that made for quick campy thrills. But over time creepypastas evolved into a style that was more reminiscent of anthological horror stories, spending a bit more time on eerie ambience, psychological horror, and clear overarching themes. You can mostly thank the rising popularity of <em>podcasts and dramatic readings</em> for this stylistic shift. Getting your creepypasta narrated by someone with a large audience was the most reliable way for novice writers to gain an audience of their own, so these writers adopted a writing style that complimented the format.</p>
          <p>I kinda see A Strange Night in the City of Angels as a spiritual midpoint between two creepypasta eras. The story is a bit too short to make it attractive to narrators. But it’s also too understated to show up at campfires and sleepovers. That might seem like a criticism, but I found this story to be an engaging read because it strikes a healthy balance. It’s short and moody and leaves just enough to the imagination.</p>
          <h3>BEN Drowned</h3>
          <p>It almost feels like cheating to list this as a creepypasta. I know most people think of it as a creepypasta, and it’s on the creepypasta fan wiki, and the creepypasta fans love to portray Ben hanging out with all the other big creepypastas in Slenderman’s mansion. But in my mind, <a href="https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/BEN_Drowned" title="BEN Drowned">BEN Drowned</a><img src="blog_img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"> was never a creepypasta.</p>
          <p>To me, BEN Drowned is an <a href="https://jadusable.withinhubris.com/Main_Page" title="Within Hubris">ARG</a><img src="blog_img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;">, which in an of itself is just the first story arc of a bigger, less accessible ARG that most people either don’t know about or choose not to acknowledge. I’m not saying the ARG is bad, or that it doesn’t have a dedicated following, but most people didn’t engage with the story beyond the initial series of posts that make up the ‘creepypasta’, as well as the hacked game footage which lent them an engaging air of credibility.</p>
          <p>Over time, I have become increasingly fascinated by the way BEN Drowned manages to be <em>two stories at once</em>: both a fairly straightforward story about a haunted video game, and a longrunning ARG about an online quasi-transhumanist cult. Whichever version you’re familiar with is likely to be the version you wanted to experience. If you’re looking for a multimedia mystery with cryptic messages and an intertwining plotlines, you’ll have an easy enough time discovering that rabbit hole. But if you prefer a simple ghost story with some creepy videos, you’ll find a creepypasta that’s clear and linear and provides a satisfying ending all on its own. </p>
          <p>I haven’t encountered many stories that manage to live two different lives at once. The closest analogue I can think of are franchises with spinoffs and diverging timelines, or maybe ones with countless fan theories, but generally those fanbases are still willing to acknowledge the different versions of a story, even if they choose not to engage. Ben Drowned exists more as an optical illusion, with people seeing different stories from the same material simultaneously. </p>
          <h3>Experiment 84-B</h3>
          <p>Slenderman gets called a homophobic slur in <a href="https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Experiment_84-B" title="Experiment 84-B">this one</a><img src="blog_img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;">.</p>
          <p>Yeah, it turns out Slenderman was actually a bullied teen. Then he got experimented on and became Slenderman. He kills people sometimes but it’s always an accident. He’s just really sad and needs a friend.</p>
          <p>Okay, maybe this one requires <strong>a bit of context</strong>.</p>
          <p>Back in the day, there was a certain subsection of creepypasta fans who really loved the characters in the creepypasta. Specifically, they loved the characters who were young and tortured and have a sympathetic backstory. A lot of the creepypastas that originated from this fandom were basically just the origin story for someone’s edgy OC. I can’t say these stories were ever my thing, but look. I was 13 once. I get it.</p>
          <p>I don’t think Experiment 84-B was made with the intention of roping Slenderman into the cast of tortured killer teens – it seems to be written for the sake of a twist ending more than anything else – but I’m sorta shocked that this interpretation of Slenderman never really caught on. Or at least I’m pretty sure it didn’t – I read a lot of creepypastas as a kid, but I was never a Creepypasta Kid. Still, I’m pretty sure I would have heard through the grapevine if the kids on Deviantart made Slenderman one of their twinks.</p>
          <p>Honestly, I’m a little disappointed??? It might seem like I’m making fun of this genre of creepypasta, but I understand the appeal of reinventing a character to serve as a vessel for your frustration. I just wish the fandom had gone way farther with it. They should’ve made Ted the Caver into a tortured prettyboy. Or the pirate from Candle Cove. Or the humanized version of tYpIng lIkE thIs. If choose to commit cringe, you might as well fully commit.</p>
          <h3>The Statue</h3>
          <p>Tell me if <a href="https://www.creepypasta.com/the-statue/" title="The Statue">this story</a><img src="blog_img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"> sounds familiar: A babysitter stays overnight and sees a creepy angel statue outside. The sitter calls the parents, who say they don’t own an angel statue. Cut to later, and the babysitter & children are later found dead.</p>
          <p>Odds are that the version of the story I’ve linked isn’t the version you remember. You remember hearing something like it, but the details have shifted. Maybe the version you remember had a clown statue, or the statue was in the childrens’ bedroom, or the children made it out alive. This creepypasta is one of the <em>OLD old creepypastas</em>. Y’know, the ones that were passed around on forums, occasionally being retold and reimagined. </p>
          <p>With that in mind, I find my attention being drawn to how modern creepypastas are preserved. You won’t see it in its natural habitat of forums and message boards. You’re more likely find it on websites dedicated to hosting creepypastas, and are structured primarily around the more recent definition of “creepypasta”. These sites are careful to give copyright disclaimers, credit to the author (Anonymous, in this case), and present a single version of the story as the definitive version. </p>
          <p>To be clear, I’m not trying to disparage these websites. Archival on the internet fucking nightmare and I do not envy their position. But I still wonder how many versions of this story are now lost, as well as the countless other creepypastas I grew up with. If you're reading this at any point in the future, I'm sorry if it's full of dead links.</p>
          <h3>The Russian Sleep Experiment</h3>
          <p>If you ask someone to name an iconic creepypasta that was unironically great, they’ll probably think you’re weird. Turns out most people don’t spend time thinking about old internet horror stories. But on the off chance that you find someone who was chronically online one decade ago, they’ll inevitably name <a href="https://www.creepypasta.com/the-russian-sleep-experiment/" title="The Russian Sleep Experiment">The Russian Sleep Experiment</a><img src="blog_img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"> as the best.</p>
          <p>Even though it’s not very good.</p>
          <p>I’ve already said that I’m not here to be a hater, and I meant it. I do think The Russian Sleep Experiment is much better than a lot of other creepypastas that were popular around the same time. Trust me, I am intimately familiar with how bad they could get. This one at least starts with a strong opening paragraph. But once the experiments are described in detail, it becomes clear that the writing style is pretty amateaurish. My biggest gripe is that the story doesn’t bother pacing itself with the slow build that would suit a story built around escalating horror. Instead it jumps from one implausible plotpoint to the next, and narrates with a bluntly sensational narrative voice that disengages the reader from the eerie tone initially establishes. By the end tries to give the impression that it’s been ramping up to its dramatic climax, but I was already bored by the time I got to that corny evil monologue about the secret twisted nature of humanity. </p>
          <p>But despite my nitpicking, I can’t fault anyone for loving this creepypasta. After all, this story has <strong>such a great premise!</strong> Because sleep is conceptually so fucking disturbing! A healthy human will spend 1/3 of their life immobile and insensate and completely vulnerable. Every day we enter a sort of temporary deathlike state that is intrinsically linked with survival in ways that are both logical and. Sure, it kinda makes sense that lying still and removing your cognitive abilities for a few hours would conserve some energy, but a lack of sleep cannot be made up for by eating carbs and lean protein. You’d still need to make up for the lapses in memory, the weakened immune system, the poor spacial orientation, the disregulated synaptic activity, and so on. There still isn’t an effective treatment for insomnia that can fully replicate and replace the benefits of just getting a decent night’s sleep. This process might be normal, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t strange.</p>
          <p>At the risk of receiving unsolicited advice, I’d like to make a confession: sleep has never come easy to me. Once in a while I can manage to drift off easily, remain deeply asleep, and wake up feeling refreshed. But I know the feeling of lacking sleep as well as I know myself. My earliest memories involve staring at the dimly-lit wall of my childhood bedroom, deeply tired but denied relief. As an adult I construct my life around delicate rituals that promise me rest at the expense of total obedience. A single deviation invites my oldest friend to slip back into that space it made for itself, snug between my skin and nerve endings. I can feel it there, <em>jittering</em> and <em>squirming</em> and <em>numbing</em> at odd intervals. Keep it there with me for two days, three if you’re lucky, and then it melds and morphs until the boundary between it and me is disassociated. I become a sluggish, irritable, ungainly creature, and there’s only so much blame I can pin on an outside force.</p>
          <p>To state my point more plainly, I find a lot about sleep and its absence casually horrifying. Oftentimes I feel alone with this thought. Most people associate sleep with positive emotions, and associate a lack of sleep with a lack of discipline. There’s only so much I can talk about the tiredness that gnaws on my gristle until there’s nothing holding my body together before it starts to sound like histrionics. So it becomes an aspect of my living that must be ignored, must be treated as normal.</p>
          <p>There’s something about The Russian Sleep Experiment that I find strangely cathartic. For all its flaws, it clearly recognizes those holes in our collective knowledge surrounding sleep, and does not hesitate to exploit them. This tiny story from the web grabs each unanswered question and every lingering sense of wrongness by the throat and forces the worst possible answers upon it. That isn’t to say I think The Russian Sleep Experiment is real, or has any basis in reality. I doubt any amount of sleep deprivation could unleash some secret monstrous evil locked away inside of us, in part because I don’t believe humans are innately evil. But my disbelief in the premise doesn’t make its idea less haunting.</p>
          <p>Because when I read it for the first time, still a child but already burnt out, I finally found something that told me <strong>yes, there is something wrong here, there’s something wrong in all of us, it’s ripping us apart it’s eating us alive it we were never meant to survive this-</strong></p>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>.....</p>
          <p>I think it’s time for me to go to bed.</p>
          <p>.......</p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10px;">(I wonder if any of this is going to make sense to me in the morning)</span></p>
