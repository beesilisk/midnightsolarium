        <h3>the legend of eternal september</h3>
        <p>It’s September 1st, 1993, and Usenet is about to become even more insufferable than usual.</p>
        <p>Such is what happens <strong>every September</strong> on Usenet. The new stock of college freshmen get their first taste of regular Internet access, so the community is flooded with clueless newbies who have little experience in online spaces and dive in without taking the time to lurk and familiarize themselves with  rules and conduct codes.</p>
        <p>You can imagine how annoying this is to Usenet natives. These are the sorts of people who are spending early 90s on one of the earliest iterations of online messageboards: <em>nerdy tech-savvy academic types</em> who hold little tolerance for what they consider to be idiocy. Technically Usenet is available to anyone with internet access, but the barrier of entry is high. Not only is the early Internet inherently less accessible than it would eventually become, but the mass flaming within newsgroups is easy to attract, and so infamously brutal that it’s a rite of passage in and of itself to survive its public humiliation rituals.</p>
        <p>And yeah, I know I sound judgy. Probably because I am judgy. But I don’t blame these people for dreading each September. They witnessed the birth of online social spaces, and they know they’re on the ground floor of something both revolutionary and fragile. Of course they’re gonna be territorial.</p>
        <p>And for the record, I’m also not blaming the newbies for their ignorance. Netiquette is not intuitive. Even when people are dedicated to adapting to fit the preexisting norms, entering a new group will always involve growing pains. And since Usenet is a niche community full of abrasive personalities, it’s inevitable that some people are not going to be a good fit. If these people are weeded out along with the types who intentionally cause problems, then there isn’t really any loss.</p>
        <p>And isn’t that incredible? An online space that isn’t meant to be everything for everyone at all times. A pseudo-social network that prioritizes its distinct identity over mass appeal. What a covetous concept. Just the thought of it makes me blush.</p>
        <p>Septembers on Usenet were annoying for veterans, but they were ultimately a sign of a <strong>healthy online ecosystem</strong>. The board would receive new users in a predictable rhythm and manageable pace, and the userbase was dedicated to punishing troublemakers. Within a few months, the new users would either learn how to behave without getting flamed, or they would find somewhere else to post unwelcome nonsense.</p>
        <p>This September is different.</p>
        <p>Because it’s September 1993, the year that AOL grants their customers Usenet access. The regular influx of new college students was dwarfed by the tide of world wide web users with myriad backgrounds and personalities.</p>
        <p>Usenet’s culture was changed irreparably. While early Usenet was predominantly focused on academia, the AOL users turned it into a more general discussion board for a wider audience. This made it a <em>safe space for cranks and weirdos to act out</em>. Had the newcomers been welcomed in the same metered fashion as before, these users would have been forced to adapt to the preexisting culture or find somewhere else to post, but the sudden mass influx caused the reverse to happen: the old users became the outgroup, and they had no choice but to accept the fact that September would never end.</p>
        <p>All of this happened before my time, but I’ve come across references to the September that never ended. If you seem some old head talking about an ‘Eternal September’, they’re usually hand-wringing about newcomers entering an established online space and irreparably ruining everything for everyone. Complaints of this nature are one of the Internet's most deeply-ingrained traditions, and I hate to ruin the fun. But I think the story of the Eternal September has more to say than just ‘new people bad’.</p>
        <p>When new users were introduced to Usenet in <strong>small, manageable waves</strong>, Usenet was able to maintain its culture with negligible interruption. But when the doors opened wider, the platform crumbled under the weight of its new uninitiated userbase.</p>
        <p>But maybe it’s too late to learn a lesson from this tale. The whole story comes off as quaint from a modern perspective, doesn’t it?. Certainly petty now that social media platforms are headed by billionaires and users are treated more like cattle headed to slaughter than members of a community. </p>
        <p>A lot has changed since September 1st, 1993. But September never ended. Can you blame me for wanting to make sense of it?</p>

        <h3>the parable of the nazi bar</h3>
        <p>It’s <span class="tooltip">September 9808th, 1993</span><span class="tooltiptext">colloquially known as July 8th, 2020</span>, and the alt-right is demanding a seat at the table.</p>
        <p>On Twitter, a man named Michael B. Tager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221221103518/https://god.dailydot.com/bartender-kicks-out-tweets/">shares a story<img src="../img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"></a> about his visit to a punk bar. The bartender seemed inclined to keep to himself, but when another patron walked into the bar, he was immediately told to leave. The bartender explained that the new guy’s vest was covered in Nazi symbols and therefore could not be tolerated.</p>
        <p>Even if the Nazi did nothing but buy a drink, allowing him to stay would <strong>turn the bar into a Nazi bar</strong>. More would come, and they would invite their friends, until Nazis became a natural part of the environment. Getting rid of them at that point would be impossible to do without serious pushback, so the only way to prevent the bar from becoming a Nazi bar is to refuse to entertain them at all.</p>
        <p>I wonder if the bartender reached this reaction intuitively. It wouldn’t shock me; I assume removing Nazis from your immediate vicinity is something that doesn’t need any justification beyond <em>“I kicked him out because he’s a fucking Nazi, and he’s lucky that’s all I did to him”</em>.</p>
        <p>But the fact that the bartender had a deeper justification, and was able to explain that justification on the spot, leads me to believe that the bartender was speaking from experience. Perhaps there was some earlier time this September, or maybe a September before this one, where the bartender witnessed exactly what happens when the Nazi is allowed a place at the bar.</p>
        <p>Not that it matters. This weblog is about Usenet, not fascism.</p>
        <p>It seems I am once again wasting my readers’ time. If Usenet doesn’t have a relevant lesson to teach us, then this Nazi bar story offers even less. I’m not a bartender, and I’m guessing you aren’t either. We can try to kick Nazis out of bars, but it wouldn’t mean as much coming from us.</p>
        <p>But isn’t it weird how the moral of this story seems to contradict what Usenet taught us? This parable isn’t saying that we should let some Nazis in and hope they get weeded out by the other patrons. Most people aren’t up-to-date on alt-right symbols and dogwhistles, so the responsibility of gatekeeping can’t be left to the masses. And even if they did kick the Nazi out of the bar, there would be nothing stopping him from coming back later.</p>
        <p>Maybe this difference can be accounted by circumstance. <strong>You can’t use the old Usenet method of metered access when it comes to fascists</strong>. Their issues go beyond poor social skills or failing to mesh with the preexisting community.</p>
        <p>Still, this parable doesn’t satisfy me. I love to hear about bad things happening to Nazis, but the message feels overly simplistic. For example: what if the Nazis showed up all at once as if they were there under your nose the entire time? What if the Nazis didn’t wear any symbols, and just looked like any other patron? What if the other patrons didn’t want the Nazis to leave, because the Nazis are family, and you wouldn’t abandon your family when they’re clearly going through a hard time, how could you be so selfish?</p>
        <p>I’m starting to suspect that overanalyzing Internet drama isn’t going to give me the answers I need.</p>

        <h3>interlude</h3>
        <p>If the parts that make up Thesues’ ship were replaced one by one until no piece of the original remained, do you think Theseus would still consider that ship to be his own ship? How much would have to change until he became an outsider? At what point does he look upon the ship that bears his name and see a stranger?</p>
        <p>If the new hull was breached and the ship capsized, would Theseus spend his final suffocating moments cursing his own ship, or a vessel that became unknown to him?</p>
         
        <h3>a short story about loss</h3>
        <p>It’s <span class="tooltip">September 11546th, 1993</span><span class="tooltiptext">colloquially known as April 11th, 2025</span>, and I don’t feel welcome in my hometown anymore.</p>
        <p>I don’t see much point in telling this story. It’s far too unoriginal.</p>
         
        <h3>dénouement</h3>
        <p>It’s easy to look fondly at dead spaces. Funerals are always flattering, flattening their subjects to fit the walls of their coffin. Memories atrophy due to the lack of exercise. When I look back on the past, especially when trying to make sense of change, I find myself falling into mindsets that aren’t accurate to the way things used to be.</p>
        <p>The truth is that <strong>the good ol’ days never existed</strong>. It hasn’t always been September 1993, but that doesn’t mean the time before was worth coveting. I think most people know this, but knowing something to be true does little to help internalize that truth.</p>
        <p>Which is why, in this weblog, I’ve perhaps been too precious about maintaining homeostasis. I know I talked shit about early Usenet (partially because of my internalized bigotry against computer nerds), but that hasn’t stopped me from framing any shift in culture as intrinsically negative.</p>
        <p>The eternal September is a prime example of how niche person-led online spaces dissolve into mass-appealing sludge puddles, but going back to the way things used to be would also suck. I’m too pretty to survive the 80s Internet. Or maybe I just have little tolerance for technolibertarianism.</p>
        <p>So how do we implement gatekeeping while remaining open to new ideas? Fuck if I know. And since I’ve never personally found value in using the Internet for socialization, I don’t consider myself qualified to spitball answers.</p>
        <p>It might seem strange that I’m discussing this at all. Well, now that we’re at the eleventh hour, it’s time I finally admit it outright: this weblog isn’t about Usenet. It’s not even about the Internet. <em>It’s about the ground crumbling beneath us.</em> Not to be dramatic or anything.</p>
        <p>I’ve always been a rather passive person, rarely a pushover but always avoiding confrontation. When the spaces I occupy are no longer benefiting me, I leave. This has saved me a lot of stress, but I wonder what will happen once there are no more spaces left for me to retreat.</p>
        <p>I don’t want to spend the rest of my life running. I want to start kicking Nazis out of the bar, and make sure everyone else has the chance grow. Hopefully it’s not too late to make up for lost time.</p>
        <p>It will always be September 1993 because what was lost on that September can never be recovered. The old Usenet is gone, and the Internet has been warped time and time again. The bar is overrun with Nazis. I no longer recognize the people who raised me. None of this can be rolled back. The scars are here to stay. We will heal regardless, and I intend to learn what I can from these old stories for as long as I still have something left to lose<span class="tooltip">.</span><span class="tooltiptext">wow, this website has such nice cozy vibes! i wish the webmaster would stop vagueing about politics tho</span></p>
