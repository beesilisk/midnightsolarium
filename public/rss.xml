			<description>created chaos garden (meant to be a hub for misc. webpages that don't fit anywhere else), made ruminations page, tweaked rss so hopefully it'll show up on nekoweb's built-in feed, tweaked layout to be a bit friendlier to smaller and medium-sized screens</description>

			<guid isPermaLink="false">is this how you make an RSS feed?</guid>
			<link>https://midnightsolarium.nekoweb.org/home</link>
			<description>finally slapped together an RSS feed (which you are reading right now! assuming i did it right!), retroactively added lazyloading to some image-heavy pages, added new slippers to craft catalog, added more notes to notebook, added one easter egg (good luck!)</description>
