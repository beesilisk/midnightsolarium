              <h2>windows management & troubleshooting tools</h2>
              <p>Windows comes prepackaged with a wide range of tools and features, and a handful of them are actually useful! Yes, really. Lets go over some troubleshooting and system management programs that don’t get deleted by those Windows <a href="https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater" alt="Windows 10 Debloater" title="Win10 Debloater">10<img src="img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"></a> & <a href="https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat" alt="Windows 10 Debloater" title="Win11 Debloater">11<img src="img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;"></a> debloater scripts.</p>
              <h3>Task Manager (taskmgr.exe)</h3>
              <p>If you’re only familiar with one of these tools, you’re familiar with Task Manager. It has a variety of uses, such as managing apps & services, logged-in accounts, and system performance.</p>
              <p>Also there are an absurd amount of ways to open Task Manager, including but not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>typing “<strong>taskmgr</strong>” in the Run command</li>
                <li>right-clicking the taskbar</li>
                <li>CTRL + ALT + DEL</li>
                <li>Win + X</li>
                <li>CTRL + Shift + ESC</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Services</h4>
              <p>A service is a type of system process that doesn’t require user interaction. Your computer will have a list of services running in the background at all times in order to function. The Task Manager Services tab shows you that list of running services as well as their identification information (description, group, status).</p>
              <h4>Startup</h4>
              <p>This tab tells you about the services that begin at startup. You can enable or disable the programs, or select <em>startup type</em> to specify how the program launches. It can also show you the impact each program has on boot time.</p>
              <div class="pic" style="width:284px;float:right;margin-left:10px;">
                <h2 class="subheader">taskmgr.exe</h2>

                <figcaption style="width:280px;">yes, i inverted this png's colors instead of switching to light mode</figcaption>
            </div>
              <h4>Performance</h4>
              <p>The Performance tab shows the resource utilization of the CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, and network. It’s especially useful when the computer is running slowly, since it can help quickly identify bottlenecking.</p>
              <p>When it comes to CPU utilization, occasional high spikes in utilization are normal. But if the utilization is consistently high, consider either upgrading other resources or running fewer processes. </p>
              <h4>Processes</h4>
              <p>This tab lists all the processes currently running on the system, and outlines each one’s consumption of various resources. By default it only shows the processes of the user that’s currently logged in, but it can also list the processes of all the accounts on the system. This tab can also be used to <strong>end tasks</strong>.</p>
              <h4>Users</h4>
              <p>Shows all the users who are currently logged in, tells you which apps they’re running, and compare the resource utilization of each account. You can also use Task Manager to send messages to users, and sign them out if needed.</p>

                <figure><img src="img/resmonmini.png" title="resource monitor" alt="resource monitor" style="width:150px;"></figure>

            </div>
              <h3>Resource Monitor (resmon.exe)</h3>
              <p>Resource Monitor is a lot like the Performance and Processes tabs in Task Manager – it lets you live monitor the system’s resource usage, as well as end processes. The main benefit of using Resource Monitor is that it’s easier to isolate a particular process or service to see its resource usage.</p>
              <h3>System Information (msinfo32.exe)</h3>
              <p>System Information shows details about the computer’s hardware and software. You would use it if you need to know about the components, peripherals, drivers, services, and network status. The tool <em>doesn’t let you make changes</em> to the system, but it’s useful for the information gathering stage of the troubleshooting process.</p>
              <h3>System Configuration (msconfig.exe)</h3>
              <p>The System Configuration utility lets you change the way Windows behaves when it boots. You would use it if you want to change the default OS, enable or disable Safe boot (aka Safe Mode), or set a timer for how long the boot potions will be displayed.</p>
              <p>The tool also lets you choose which services will run at startup – but if you want to change which apps run on startup, you’ll want to go to Task Manager.</p>
              <h3>Registry Editor (regedit.exe)</h3>
              <p>The registry is a database that stores configuration settings related to the OS, device, and software. You can alter pretty much every aspect of Windows through the Registry Editor. It’s a powerful tool if you know what you’re doing, but it should be approached with caution. Mistakes can cause serious issues, up to and including bricking the entire system.</p>
              <h3>Disk Cleanup (cleanmgr.exe)</h3>
              <p>If your storage drive is running low on space, Disk Cleanup can be used to free up room by deleting files. The files it deletes are typically unimportant, like temporary files and the recycle bin, but you can review the files before they’re deleted and specify which types of files you’d like to remove or keep.</p>
              <h3>Disk Defragment (dfrgui.exe)</h3>
              <p>Unlike Disk Cleanup, the Disk Defragment tool <strong>does not delete anything</strong> from the system. Instead, it reorganizes the data blocks spread throughout the <span class="tooltip">physical disk</span><span class="tooltiptext">There are technically ways to defragment an SSD too, but doing so is even less necessary – if fact, it’s more likely to damage the drive due to unnecessary wear and tear</span> so that files are kept in the same area, speeding up the disk’s read times. This tool isn’t as necessary as it used to be now that Windows defragments drives automatically, but using it to optimize performance won’t hurt anything.</p>
              <h3>MMC (mmc.exe)</h3>
              <p>The Microsoft Management Console is less of a tool on its own and more of a container used to bring numerous tools into a single space. </p>
              <p>MMC snap-ins are all programs that can be accessed on their own, but the MMC is a convenient space for pulling up whichever tools you need at once. It also lots you save the console setup, so you can quickly pull up whichever assortment of tools you find yourself using most.</p>
              <h4>Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc)</h4>
              <p>Event Viewer shows Windows’ log files related to events. It’s typically used to review previous errors, and is especially useful when you want to see old error messages.</p>
              <p>There are 4 main log files:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>System</strong> – log for events related to the core OS</li>
                <li><strong>Application</strong> – log for 3rd-party software and non-core processes</li>
                <li><strong>Security</strong> – log for system audit data</li>
                <li><strong>Setup</strong> – log for events that occur during installation</li>
              </ul>
              <p>It’s worth mentioning that even though Event Viewer is often associated with errors, not every “event” will be critical errors. It also records audit logs, occurrences that OS deems noteworthy, and warnings for potential future issues.</p>
              <h4>Disk Management (diskmgmt.msc)</h4>
              <p>This shows you information regarding the system’s storage drives, and lets you create and format drives on physical disks. Most of this tool’s functions and more can be done using the command-line tool <strong>diskpart</strong>, but Disk Management wraps it in an easy-to-use GUI. Be careful when using this tool, because it’s very easy to make irreversible changes and lose data. </p>

                <figcaption style="width:300px;">don't talk to me, im busy scheduling my tasks</figcaption>
            </div>
              <h4>Task Scheduler (taskschd.msc)</h4>
              <p>Task Scheduler lets you automate tasks so that they run at specified times. It’s used to launch programs and scripts at a predetermined time, or when certain criteria is met, such as at login or when the computer is idle. You often see it used for simple tasks like turning computers on or off, sending notifications, or <a href="weblog_posts/backups.html">creating backups</a>, but it can also be used to run more advanced scripts.</p>
              <h4>Device Manager (devmgmt.msc)</h4>
              <p>Lets you view the status of devices, view their properties, and configure their parameters. It can be used to enable or disable hardware, which can be useful for troubleshooting. But it’s more frequently used to manage <em>drivers</em>, allowing you to enable or disable them, roll back to previous versions of drivers, or identify errors and software conflicts.</p>
              <h4>Certificate Manager (certmgr.msc)</h4>
              <p>Certificate Manager is used to see the certificates used by the OS, as well as any web browsers installed on the system. It also lets you install and remove certificates, and allows you to modify its trust lists and revocation lists. When troubleshooting issues related to authentication, it’s good to check the certificates to make sure any software or web applications being used are trustworthy.</p>
              <h4>Local Users and Groups (lusrmgr.msc)</h4>
              <p>If you only a Home version of Windows installed, you won’t be able to find this tool.  For those of us with Pro or higher, Local Users and Groups provides an in-depth console for managing accounts on the local network. From here you can create, modify and disable accounts, manage their passwords, assign account permissions, or connect them to shared drives. You can also manage the permissions of individual users, or assign permissions to entire groups.</p>

                <figcaption style="width:290px;">i am NOT gonna explain the policies themselves; i value my time</figcaption>
              </div>
              <h4>Local Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc)</h4>
              <p>The Group Policy Editor provides a GUI for configuring Windows settings. It technically performs a similar function to the Registry Editor, but its GUI is a lot more user-friendly, so it’s a shame it’s not available on Home versions of Windows. But I suppose it makes sense – this tool is more useful for modifying <strong>broader system settings</strong> within an Active Directory domain, as opposed to managing managing local accounts via lusrmgr.msc.</p>
              <p>As well as letting you configure OS settings, vendors can also write administrative templates that make third-party software configurable through the Group Policy Editor.</p>
              <h4>Performance Monitor (perfmon.msc)</h4>
              <p>I know some confuse Performance Monitor with Resource Monitor, which makes sense. Both tools are used to monitor system resource utilization. But once you actually use these tools, it’s clear that these are two very different pieces of software.</p>
              <p>When you first open up Performance Monitor, you won’t be shown any monitors or live feeds. You need to <em>manually select</em> which resource you want it to monitor – and the list of resources it provides is far more exhaustive than most other monitoring tools. Once selected, Performance Monitor will start generating a counter or trace log.</p>
              <p>It’s considered best practice to use Performance Monitor to measure resource utilization at different times of the day, or at regular intervals throughout the year. This gives you a thorough understanding of the system’s typical performance, and gives you a frame of reference when troubleshooting specific issues.</p>

            <div id="logicsec-wrapper" class="tabcontent">
              <article>
                <h2>some logical security measures</h2>
                <h3>What Do You Mean by "Logical Security"?</h3>
                <p>Logical security refers to the digital security measures taken to protect computers and the data within them. You can think of it as the equal opposite of <em>physical security</em>, i.e. making sure nobody can just walk up and steal your laptop.</p>
                <h3>Principle of Least Privilege</h3>
                <p>This principle states that users should be given <strong>only what they absolutely need</strong> in order to perform their tasks. Everything else should be restricted.</p>
                <p>Usually this term is used in reference to user account privileges. After all, not everyone needs to be an administrator. Granting every user high-level access would increase the risk of accidents and security breaches. By restricting a user's privileges, you also restrict the privileges of any malware that infects the system.</p>
                <p>This principle may seem straightforward, but its importance should not be overlooked. Make sure all users are assigned to the correct group, don't give users the ability to modify newly installed programs, and don't start granting higher privileges out of laziness.</p>
                <h3>ACLs</h3>
                <p>Access Control Lists outline the <em>permissions</em> and <em>restrictions</em> set for a user or system. They dictate which accounts are allowed to particular files, folders, programs, or network resources.</p>
                <p>As well as being built into the OS, ACLs can also be configured on routers, firewalls, and switches for traffic filtering.</p>
                <h3>MFA</h3>
                <p>Multifactor authentication verifies the identity of a user by having them use at least 2 different methods of gaining access. Verification methods are split into 3 categories:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>something you <strong>know</strong> (e.g. passwords & PINs)</li>
                  <li>something you <strong>have</strong> (e.g. phones & keyboards)</li>
                  <li>something you <strong>are</strong> (e.g. figerprints & voice recognition)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unlike 2-factor authentication, MFA must incorporate different authentication methods from different categories, such as a password + fingerprint combo. MFA can also incorporate more than 2 steps.</p>
                <h3>Email Filtering</h3>
                <p>Email is one of the most frequently exploited security vulnerabilities, so it's important to filter unwanted and malicious emails. In organizations, this is usually done through an <em>email gateway</em>. These are able to scan emails to look for malicious attachments and block unwanted emails before they can reach a user's inbox. The email gateway can be implemented by using either an onsite server or cloud service.</p>
                <h3>Hard Tokens</h3>
                <p>A hard token is a <strong>physical object</strong> that's required to gain access to network resources. If a person doesn't have the USB, smart card, or key fob on hand, they cannot gain access. This sounds like an elegantly simple security system, but it falls apart if the hard token is lost or stolen.</p>
                <h3>Soft Tokens</h3>
                <p>Also known as a <strong>one-time password</strong>, a soft token is a form of authentication data that's generated for a single use only. This data usually comes in the form of a temporary PIN, often delivered via email, SMS, or voice call. It's used a lot on 2FA and MFA because of its relative convenience and cost-effectiveness compated to hard tokens, but they are more susceptible to hacking.</p>
                <h3>Authenticator Apps</h3>
                <p>Authenticator apps let people access resources <em>without a password</em>. Instead, the service or network is registered with the software, making it inaccessible to anyone without an account on the app. If someone with an account tries to gain access (usually done by scanning a QR code, copying an alphanumeric key, or a biometric scan), the app will send them a soft token.</p>
                <p>Unlike soft tokens sent over SMS, these apps work without cell service or internet access. The keys are also easier to encrypt and sync across devices. But if you lose access to your account, app, or device, the service becomes inaccessible.</p>

                  <h2>cybersecurity threats</h2>
                  <p>im back with more IT study notes because nobody has tried to stop me yet. also i made a new webpage for 'em! cool, right?</p>
                  <h3>What Are Threats?</h3>
                  <p>Okay, the word “ <strong>threat</strong>” might seem overly vague. But when you're talking about cybersecurity, a threat is generally considered to be any action that could exploit vulnerabilities in the system or network. If someone takes advantage of that vulnerability, the threat will result in missing, stolen, or damaged data. </p>
                  <p>Another term I'm gonna be using is “ <b>threat actor</b>”. This refers to whoever is responsible for the threat. They can be a single person or a large group, come from any background, and act under a wide range of motivations. </p>
                  <h3>Insider Threat</h3>
                  <p>An insider threat can come from anyone who's granted permissions on the system. These threat actors are hard to protect against because the attacker is <i>someone who's expected to be on the network</i>. </p>
                  <p>Sometimes insider threat actors will spend years within an organization for the purpose of collecting data and finding vulnerabilities. Other times the threat actor could be a normally trustworthy person who was bribed or blackmailed. The threat actor could also be a hired contractor or 3rd party vendor with a secret agenda.</p>
                  <p>Or sometimes the reasons are less interesting. Got an employee who keeps falling for phishing emails? That's an insider threat too.</p>
                  <p>The motivations behind insider threats are infinitely varied, but we can put them into 2 categories:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>malicious</strong> (e.g. an employee at Evil Inc. realizes that they're the baddies and decides to leak confidential data to a team of plucky rebels), and</li>
                    <li><strong>non-malicious</strong> (e.g. your idiot child tries to download My Sim Aquarium from a sketchy website and infects the family computer with malware (sorry dad))</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>What I'm saying is that, like all threat actors, an insider threat can can come from anyone with any skillset for any reason.</p>
                  <h3>Zero-Day Attack</h3>
                  <p>This describes any sort of threat that <em>exploits an unpatched vulnerability</em> within a system or piece of software – particularly, vulnerabilities that have been present since launch. </p>
                  <p>These vulnerabilities exist either because they are undiscovered, or because a patch hasn't been made (maybe a patch is still in the works, maybe the flaw is impossible to fully patch, or maybe the vulnerability is being ignored out of negligence). Sometimes zero-day vulnerabilities go years and years without being fixed or even discovered until a threat actor decides to exploit it.</p>
                  <p>These threats aren&apos;t as common as you might expect. Usually software is heavily researched and tested before launch to make sure there aren't any catastrophic security vulnerabilities. That said, a serious design flaw slipping through the cracks could end in catastrophe.</p>
                  <h3>Footprinting</h3>
                  <p>Footprinting is when the threat actor tries to gather information and <strong>discover vulnerabilities</strong>. The attacker researches their target using a wide range of methods, including collecting publicly available info, scanning network ports, and using social engineering (aka tricking people) to extract information. </p>
                  <p>Once the attacker has gathered information on their target, they will analyze their data and strategically plan their attack.</p>
                  <p>While footprinting can be a threat, it's also done by penetration testers in order assess security.</p>
                  <h3>Spoofing</h3>
                  <p>Spoofing happens when the threat actor pretends to be something trustworthy.</p>
                  <p>Most people think of spoofing as an attacker pretending to be a trustworthy person or from a trustworthy organization, but spoofing can also be:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>cloning a valid IP or MAC address</li>
                    <li>using a fake digital certificate</li>
                    <li>stealing authentication tokens (such as web cookies)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Essentially, spoofing is a general term that describes <em>impersonation</em>. </p>
                  <h3>On-Path Attack</h3>
                  <p>This is form of spoofing where the threat actor secretly sits in the middle of a 2-way conversation between two devices. The attacker is able to capture the packets of data being sent, analyze their contents, and send them to their destination without anyone else noticing. This threat is also known as a <b>man-in-the-middle</b> attack. </p>
                  <p>Sometimes the attacker can even modify the packets before sending them to their destination, or prevent the transmission from reaching its destination at all. But usually on-path attacks are trying to <i>steal password hashes</i>. When trying to steal information, it’s in the attacker’s best interest to do as little tampering as possible. </p>
                  <h3>ARP Poisoning</h3>
                  <p>This is a specific type of on-path attack that exploits a weakness in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). This is the protocol that identifies each device’s unique MAC via the device’s known IP address. This allows packets of data to be delivered across a network to the correct machine.</p>
                  <p>Using ARP spoofing, an attacker can trick a machine into associating a MAC address with the attacker’s device instead of the correct one. This lets the attacker <i>assume another device’s identity</i> and use it for spying or spoofing &ndash; all without having to steal a username or password. </p>
                  <h3>Brute-Force Attack</h3>
                  <p>Earlier on I mentioned <em>password hashes</em>. These are the way a password is represented in data. There are many different algorithms used for password hashing, they all encrypt the password into a different string of text. </p>
                  <p>For example, if the password “ <em>password123</em>” using the SHA-1 algorithm, that password will be stored in a database as “ <i style="word-break: break-all;">cbfdac6008f9cab4083784cbd1874f76618d2a97</i>”. If that database is breached, the attacker would find the hash but not the original password. </p>
                  <p>A brute-force attack is a threat based around decrypting hashes back into their original passwords. The attacker would use a script that <b>converts random character strings into their hashed form</b>. If they can recreate a known hash, that means the attacker has found the actual password. </p>
                  <h3>Dictionary Attack</h3>
                  <p>This is another method of decrypting password hashes. Unlike brute-force attacks that generate random character strings to convert into hashes, dictionary attacks generate passwords based on <b>words and phrases</b>. After all, people are more likely to use words in their passwords than a random keysmash. </p>
                  <p>Some dictionary attack scripts might generate hashes by going through every possible word, but others will favour words and phrases that are known to be common in passwords, such as‘<i>12345</i>’, ‘<i>iloveyou</i>’, ‘<i>P@55w0rd</i>’, or words related to the organization being targeted.</p>
                  <h3>DoS Attacks</h3>
                  <p>A denial of service attack is any attack that <strong>makes a service inaccessible</strong>. You could do this by exploiting a design failure that causes software to crash, downloading an overly large file, or physically cutting a computer’s power cable. </p>
                  <p>That said, when most people talk about DoS attack, they're specifically referring to an attack that involves services being overloaded by an onslaught of spoofed traffic. The coordinated influx of network traffic brings the system down under the weight of too many requests.</p>
                  <p>It's worth noting that sometimes cutting off a service is not the attacker's end goal. DoS attacks are very disruptive and obvious, which makes them great distractions for subtler threats.</p>
                  <h3>DDoS Attacks</h3>
                  <p>A <i>distributed</i> denial of service attack is designed is much harder to stop than a regular DoS attack, which is why you hear about them more often. These attack from <b>multiple locations</b> in order to bring down their target. Attacking from many different sources at once makes them hard to block. </p>
                  <p>DDoS attacks come in many different varieties, but pretty much all of them work by overwhelming a server with traffic. This is typically done using botnets, which are devices connected to the internet that are under the control of a 3rd party. These devices are often infected with malware, transforming them into remotely controlled attacking machines.</p>
                  <h3>SQL Injections</h3>
                  <p>When an uninvited 3rd party is able to alter an application’s code, this considered to be an <em>injection</em>. There are many injection techniques made for altering different types of code, but SQL injections are probably the most well-known. </p>
                  <p>The SQL programming language is what allows the data in databases to be manipulate. An injection works by <strong>tampering with the SQL queries</strong> as they’re being sent to or from the server. This allows the attacker to covertly steal and even modify data stored on the server. Sometimes a SQL injection can create backdoor to the server itself, which provides an opportunity for further attacks on the backend infrastructure. </p>
                  <h3>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>
                  <p>When a user clicks a link to a website or enters the site’s URL, that person’s web browsers will generally trust the scripts running on that site. Threat actors can take advantage of this by using a website’s user submission feature &ndash; this includes things forums, comment sections, and guestbooks.</p>
                  <p>Without proper safeguards, features like these allow threat actors to <strong>inject malicious scripts onto a trusted site’s code</strong>. </p>
                  <p>In action, cross-site scripting will often look like a comment with a link to another website. If you click that link, the attacker’s malicious code will activate. This could result in stolen data, cookie hijacking and malware infection, just to name a few examples.</p>
                  <p><b>NOTE:</b> This is only a very general overview, but amateur webmasters like myself might wanna <a href="https://patchthenet.com/blog/introduction-to-cross-site-scripting-xss">read more<img src="img/outlink2.png" style="padding-left:3px;opacity:0.6;vertical-align:top;">

                <article>
                  <h2>this is literally just a list of different types of malware</h2>
                  <aside><b>01/09/24</b> - this was originally posted in the weblog section of this site, but the webmaster decided to move it to its own</aside>
                  <hr />
                  <p>lately ive been studying for my comptia a+ cert, and i decided to infodump on my website as a form of studying because i can do whatever i want here</p>
                  <p>im kicking off with a simple list of malware types because i figure it will make a good starting point as i decide how to translate the material into an <em>easily digestible, beginner-friendly</em> blog post. also i just find this stuff interesting </p>
                  <p>since this is effectively a summarization of my notes, i wont be going into too much detail, and i might make some generalizations. at most, you should consider this your own jumping off point and <b>do your own research</b>
                  </p>
                  <h3>Trojan</h3>
                  <p>Trojans <em>hide inside the installer packages</em> for legitimate-looking programs. Once installed, it&rsquo;s granted the same privileges as the program and executable. A trojan may be able to achieve persistence – meaning it hides inside startup folders or scheduled tasks so it can retrigger whenever the computer restarts, even if the system&rsquor;s credentials are changed. </p>
                  <h3>Rootkit</h3>
                  <p>Rootkits take advantage of operating system functions in order to <em>elevate their privileges</em>. They like to plant themselves within the operating system, sometimes even fusing with the kernel itself (as well as bootloaders, firmware, hypervisors, memory, or applications). This makes them very hard to identify using your typical troubleshooting software. You&rsquo;ll need to find a <strong>3rd-party remover software</strong> specific to whichever rootkit you&rsquo;re dealing with. </p>
                  <h3>Virus</h3>
                  <p>The word &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;virus&rdquor; a broad term used to describe <em>malware that can self-replicate</em>. The initial infection <strong>always requires some form of human interaction</strong> (e.g. clicking on a malicious download link), but once executed the virus will be granted the same privileges as the infected process. From there it may be able to infect other files, drives, and even spread to other systems via the network or removable drives. </p>
                  <h3>Spyware</h3>
                  <p>After tricking the user into installing it, spyware will <em>covertly collect data</em> on their victim. Its goal is usually either to steal confidential data, or collect data for advertising. While most remain covert, some may make changes to the browser configuration such as allowing tracking cookies or changing the default search engine. Some might even take screenshots or turn on recording devices. </p>
                  <h3>Ransomware</h3>
                  <p>Ransomware is a malware attack that makes some or all of computer&rsquo;s data / functions inaccessible as a means of extortion. Cryptocurrency is often demanded as payment to release the system, making the attackers hard to track down after the transaction. These attacks sound scarier than they actually are – <em>assuming you make regular external backups</em> (^ω~)☆ </p>
                  <h3>Crypto-Ransomware</h3>
                  <p>This is a form of ransomware that <em>encrypts all or part of a user&rsquo;s data</em>. The victim won&rsquo;t be able to access those files until the attacker gives them access to an encryption key. The key is actually kept on the computer from the very start, but it&rsquo;s also encrypted. </p>
                  <p><b>NOTE:</b> I&rsquo;ve seen some people use this term synonymously with ransomware in general, cryptojacking, or any ransomware that demands cryptocurrency as payment. The definition I gave is the one CompTIA uses, and I find it&rsquo;s the most commonly used definition in general.</p>
                  <h3>Keyloggers</h3>
                  <p>Keyloggers are a form of spyware that <em>tracks every keystroke and mouse click</em> made on the computer. The info is then sent to the attacker for them analyze. This essentially circumvents whichever encryption methods you&rsquor;re using. These can be used to steal private data, passwords, or credit card numbers. Keyloggers can be implemented using software, 3rd-party websites, and modified USB adapters. </p>
                  <h3>Boot Sector Virus </h3>
                  <p>These are viruses that <em>infect the boot sector or Master Boot Record (MBR)</em> of a disk drive. Once infecting the boot sector, it will then spread to other disks on the computer. By attaching to the code used to start the operating system, the computer will essentially be <strong>reinfected each time it restart</strong>s – before the antivirus software has a chance to launch. From an outside perspective, it&rsquor;ll look like the virus keeps coming back each time the computer starts, even after you think its been removed. Luckily, Secure Boot is good at preventing these viruses. </p>
                  <h3>Cryptojacking</h3>
                  <p>Cryptominers perform cryptographic computations to create cryptocurrency &ndash; in other words, they mine crypto. Cryptojackers can infect other computers and <em>use their processing power to mine crypto</em>. </p>
                  <p><b>NOTE:</b> while some resources like the CompTIA A+ Student Guide (220-1101 & 220-1102) use the terms “cryptomining” and “cryptojacking” interchangeably, i find most people distinguish between the two. <strong>Cryptomining</strong> refers broadly to the act of mining crypto, while <strong>cryptojacking</strong> is the act of using malware to mine crypto using another system&rsquor;s resources.</p>
                  <p><span style="font-size:14">(dont get me wrong, i have very little love for cryptominers, but i feel using specificity in language is important </span><span style="font-size:11;">especially in the age of misinformation </span><span style="font-size:8;">but thats just my opinion)</span></p>
                  <h3>Worms</h3>
                  <p>Unlike a typical virus, worms <strong>don&rsquo;t need to wait for a human victim to unknowingly activate them</strong>. They are self-operating, self-replicating, self-activating programs that can wriggle their way into an operating system by exploiting known security vulnerabilities. They often spread between hosts in a network and slow down system resources. </p>
                  <h3>Fileless Malware</h3>
                  <p>While most malware comes in the form of an executable file, fileless malware disguises itself as a legitimate script or document while <em>residing in the computer&rsquor;s memory</em>. From there it infects and exploits useful system processes such as scripting environments (especially Powershell). This malware hard to detect using regular antimalware software. </p>

            <!-- backups -->
            <div id="backups-wrapper" class="tabcontent">
                <article>
                  <h2>backups</h2>
                  <p>Have you you remembered to back up your data recently? Yes, I’m speaking to you specifically. Go back up your data.</p>
                  <h3>Full Backups</h3>
                  <p>There are multiple types of backups for you to choose based on your needs and the technology you have at your disposal.</p>
                  <p>A full backup <em>creates a copy</em> of everything on the file system. The exact definition of “everything” might vary depending on who you ask, but it can include the operating system, settings, and files. The copy is gonna be more or less the same size as the original.</p>
                  <p>A full backup can completely restore the dataset on its own, but the drawback is that it’s <strong>time-consuming</strong> and <strong>eats up storage space</strong>. This is probably fine if you’re just backing up your personal files, but anything large-scale is probably gonna want a backup system that’s less resource intensive.</p>
                  <h3>Incremental Backups</h3>
                  <p>An incremental backup actually requires 2 types of backups: first, a full backup of the data is created. After that, an incremental backups will only <em>copy the data that’s changed</em> since the full backup. Each subsequent incremental backup will store the data that’s changed since the previous full or incremental backup. The end result is that you have a full backup as well as several smaller increments.</p>
                  <p>This is a great backup system if you want to store data quickly and take up the least storage space, which is why it’s used a lot in cloud storage. The one downside is that it <strong>takes a while to recover</strong> all the data, since the process requires combining several backup in order to rebuild the dataset. It’s probably not the best solution if you want the recovery process to be quick and easy.</p>
                    <img class="body_img" style="float:left;padding-right:15px;"src="img/full-differential-incremental.png" title="a diagram showing full, differential, and incremental backups" alt="a diagram showing full, differential, and incremental backups">
                  <h3>Differential Backups</h3>
                  <p>This is a lot like an incremental backup, but with one major difference: the backup containing the changed data <em>doesn’t reset each time</em>. Instead of creating several small increments, every change made from the full backup is copied onto a single differential backup. Over time, the differential backup grows bigger and bigger. </p>
                  <p>To recover the full dataset, you would only need the last full backup and the most recent differential backup. This is still more complex than creating a single full backup, merging two backups is a lot easier than merging several increments. Differential backups are also a <strong>good compromise</strong> when it comes to backup speed and storage requirements. </p>
                  <h3>Onsite vs. Offsite</h3>
                  <p>An onsite backup is kept in the same physical location as the original data. This may be more convenient and save on bandwidth, but it also means that every version of the data could be lost in the event of a disaster.</p>
                  <p>In a work environment, it’s generally considered best practice to <em>keep at least one offsite backup</em>. In larger organizations, backups might be sent to a server in another company branch in another part of the world. If you wanna do this for personal files, the best way to do this would probably be through a cloud service.</p>
                  <h3>Backup Frequency</h3>
                  <p>There isn’t any golden rule dictating how often backups should be made. For my own personal files, I have everything automatically backed up at the end of each week. This is probably the most infrequent you’ll ever see data backed up in a work environment. Most businesses prefer to keep daily backups, though depending on their priorities you might also have backups made every few hours or minutes.</p>
                  <p>The amount of time you keep each backup around also varies. Depending on the data, <strong>there might be regulations</strong> dictating how long the data should be stored, so it’s best to be aware of company guidelines.</p>
                  <p>You should regularly test your backup system to make sure everything is being stored properly. The industry standard is to test the backup system once a month at minimum. Highly sensitive data should be checked even more often.</p>
                  <h3>3-2-1 Rule</h3>
                  <p>This is a best practice guideline for businesses.  The rule states that 3 copies of a backup should be taken: <em>2 copies onsite</em>, and <em>1 kept offsite</em>. This you have 2 versions of the dataset at your immediate disposal, while also keeping it preserved elsewhere.</p>
                  <h3>Grandfather-Father-Son</h3>
                  <p>Also called a “first-in, first-out” rotation schedule, this is a best practice guideline where new backup is made every day. At the end of the week, the most recent daily backup becomes the new weekly backup. The last weekly backup of the month becomes the new monthly backup.</p>
                  <p>The end result is that you have 3 backups at all times: a daily backup, a weekly backup, and a monthly backup. As time goes on, the <strong>most recent of each gets promoted</strong> into the next category.</p>
                  <p>To be clear, this isn’t mutually exclusive to the 3-2-1 backup rule, though you might see businesses using one backup scheme being used but not the other, or they could have their own system that suits their specific needs. But these are considered best practice for a reason: they keep backups available and well-archived.</p>
