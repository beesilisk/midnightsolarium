<p>Hey there visitor! I see you&rsquo;ve stumbled upon my website, despite the fact that there&rsquo;s not much here to look at yet. Or maybe you&rsquo;re from the distant future, and you&rsquo;re only reading this inaugural post out of curiosity. Either way, <b>welcome!</b></p>
<p>Seeing how this is my first blog post, I figure it makes sense to talk about why I created this weblog section in the first place. I promise my explanation will be very straightforward and not a meandering diatribe. Haha.</p>
<h3>a meandering diatribe: part 1</h3>
<p>Back in November 2022, a blogger named Cory Doctorow wrote an article titled <a href="https://locusmag.com/2023/01/commentary-cory-doctorow-social-quitting/" title="external link to article">Social Quitting</a> about the decline of social media. In it, he coined the term &ldquo;<strong>enshittification</strong>&rdquo;. A couple months later, Doctorow posted a second article, <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/" title="external link to article">The &apos;Enshittification&apos; of TikTok</a>, to expand upon the concept.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know, the idea is that these popular websites have become entrenched in the everyday lives of their userbase, to the point where leaving would require an exhaustive lifestyle change. This has led to companies gradually <em>removing the quality of life</em> perks which earned them success in the first place.</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;enshittification&rsquo; become a popular online buzzword these past couple years. You&apos;ve probably come across it already. If you&rsquo;re from the future, this dated online lingo might be painful to witness. My apologies.</p>
              <figure style="float:right;">
                <img class="body_img"
                  src="blog_img/wired_sub.png"
                  title="a screenshot of Wired.com's subscription popup"
                  alt="a screenshot of Wired.com's subscription popup"
				  style="width:400px;">
                <figcaption style ="max-width:400px;">
                  "for $5 we'll show you an article that other sites host for free" is not the future of tech i want, but thanks ig
                </figcaption>
              </figure>
<p>And hey, did you notice that I linked to both those articles? You should click those links. I took the time to find them for you, and doing that took longer than it should&rsquo;ve. Turns out when you type <em>The &apos;Enshittification&apos; of TikTok</em> into your preferred search engine, the first result will be on <strong>Wired.com</strong>, which reproduced the essay only to hide it behind their subscription paywall for anyone who&rsquo;s seen an undeclared amount of previous Wired articles. The first search result to show you <em>Social Quitting</em> will be <strong>Medium</strong>, which has the exact same sort of paywall. There are other sites that provide these articles for free, but you have to look harder to find them.</p>
<p>Let me make one thing clear: <strong>those articles were not stolen</strong>. Cory Doctorow is a contributor for Wired and Medium. He reposted those articles himself. And honestly, I don&rsquo;t hold that against him. They&rsquo;re fascinating articles, and Doctorow is clearly both knowledgeable and passionate about the topic, so I respect his effort to reach a wider audience by utilizing larger platforms.</p>
<p>But <strong>holy shit</strong>, these websites cannot read the room.</p>
<h3>blogging in the enshittification age</h3>
<p>This has been the state of online content for a while now. Within the past decade or so, news outlets and mass blogging platforms have been rolling out paywalls to restrict formerly free content. Resources like <a href="https://12ft.io/"title="external link to site">12ft.io</a> and the <a href="https://archive.org/" title="external link to site">Internet Archive</a> are usually able to remove popups, but those are workarounds, not solutions to the wider issue.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be frustrated if the problem was only content restriction. If, for example, bloggers were choosing to create bonus content for paid supporters, that would be reasonable. In a perfect world this work would be free and accessible, but I understand that writers have bills to pay. But that&rsquo;s not what the <em>Wired.coms</em> and <em>Mediums&nbsp;</em>across the web are doing. The deceptive corporate paywalls, the overbearing presence of centralized publishing platforms, the commercial interests burying quality search results&mdash;these are all symptoms of the blogosphere&rsquo;s enshittification epidemic.</p>
<p>I could keep complaining about big-name content aggregates, but personal blogs have had their own downfall and I&rsquo;m not letting them off the hook. When I was looking for resources to help create this site&rsquo;s weblog, pretty much every piece of advice I found on the mainstream web focused solely on marketing strategy. Blogging was advertised to me as a way to cultivate my <strong>personal / professional</strong> brand (the distinction between the two seemed to be nonexistent). I was given long lists of self-promotion strategies that I didn&rsquo;t ask for. Advice for writing a blog post only touched the various AI tools I could use to generate outlines, drafts, or entire posts. In the eyes of <em>How to Start A Blog in 2024 (8 easy steps!)</em>, a blog is nothing but a vessel for accruing capital.</p>
<p>When I look at a lot of so-called personal blogs, I get the impression that they&rsquo;re built on this foundation. I&rsquo;ve come across sites that are constantly posting but never say anything new or insightful. And when I say <em>never</em>, I <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> say it with some <em>snobby you-guys-suck-at-writing</em> attitude. These bloggers are recounting a popular twitter thread. Or just rewording a post from 3 weeks ago. Or selling multivitamins. I guess if you want to make money, you must become a content farm.</p>
<h3>obligatory &ldquo;social media bad&rdquo; rant</h3>
<p>Somehow, the least awful form of blogging comes from <strong>social media</strong>. In a sense, most social media platforms offer a form of <em>microblogging</em>. Anytime you have a thought you want to share, you can make a quick post share it with a wide audience. This broadcasting of our lives has become so ubiquitous that it has reshaped social interaction (if you don&rsquo;t believe me, delete all your socials and see how easy it is to stay in touch with everyone). Even when these popular websites chip away at their product by restricting content, locking algorithmic success behind a subscription fee, or banning marginalized users en masse, the new websites that crop up as an alternative generally offer the same microblogging services but without the sleazy add-ons and restrictions.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a stretch to call someone&rsquo;s twitter feed a blog, but it&rsquo;s the most prevailing remnant of old web diaries surviving on modern platforms. And it&rsquo;s not a format that&rsquo;s going away anytime soon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great for people who like social media. Assuming such people exist.</p>
<p>Okay okay, I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time whining about my grievances re: social media, because:</p>
<ol>
    <li>1. it&rsquo;s a <strong>dense</strong> topic that deserves its own discussion, and</li>
    <li>2. it&rsquo;s such an <em>overdone</em> topic that i have nothing new to contribute</li>
</ol>
<p>but I do want to pose the idea that the ubiquity of social media has changed the way people engage with the internet as a whole. Our social media pages exist as shrines to ourselves, our thoughts, our interests, our fears. Kids don&rsquo;t want to make art and post it online; they want to be <em>influencers</em>. Adults don&rsquo;t make personal websites; they construct <em>personal brands</em>. Same thing, different generations imo.</p>
<p>And these aren&rsquo;t inherently bad things! I know people who armchair diagnose this as some &ldquo;narcissism&rdquo; epidemic, but that&rsquo;s way too cynical. I think of it as a manifestation of peoples&rsquo; desire for self-expression and camaraderie. The internet has become soul-crushingly corporate, and people are doing their best to survive within a hostile framework.</p>
<p>My worry is that the ubiquity of online identity as a personal brand has become the default. Because if <em>condensing your life into a consumable product</em> is a <strong>requirement</strong> for being on the web, that sucks for <strong>me </strong>in particular. I hate marketing myself. Or making myself palatable to strangers. Or sharing personal information in general.</p>
<p>Umm...</p>
<p>Maybe the real question isn&rsquo;t why did i make this blog, but rather <strong>why did i make a personal website.</strong></p>
<h3>dissecting my motives (and poking the gross parts with a stick)</h3>
<p>To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t create midnight solarium with any strict vision for what it would be. This site exists because I was sick of the internet being a place to look at advertisements and arguments and every awful thing happening in the world, all while corporations used my personal data to train algorithms that will only make the web more hostile to my fellow users.</p>
<p>Nostalgia is a drug, and I try to indulge only in moderation. I know the internet was always flawed. But still, <strong>I remember a time when it offered more and hurt less.</strong></p>
<p>Then I found out about Neocities. I found simple guides explaining html and css. I started piecing together code because it was more fun than doomscrolling.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m a cynical bastard, my vision for this website began with a list of things it wouldn&rsquo;t be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>- a <strong>content farm</strong></li>
    <li>- a <strong>product</strong> to sell</li>
    <li>- a way to sell products</li>
    <li>- a way to sell <em>myself</em> like a product</li>
    <li>- a less accessible reskin of my socials</li>
</ul>
<p>I stand by those rules, but looking back, I find them a bit embarrassing. They were born out of frustration, not creativity. As my planning became more fleshed out, I developed an idea of what my website would be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>- a laid-back space to decompress</li>
    <li>- a <strong>low-pressure</strong> ongoing project</li>
    <li>- an excuse to <em>try new things</em> &amp; experiment</li>
    <li>- a way to share the things I make (even if they aren&rsquo;t anything special)</li>
    <li>- a way to gush about things I&rsquo;m passionate about</li>
</ul>
<p>These guidelines are vague, but I want to leave doors open for myself without falling back on common practices I&rsquo;m trying to distance myself from. Y&rsquo;know, like those blogs that keep getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>Visitor, it you&rsquo;re still reading this, I&rsquo;m gonna let you in on a secret: when I first decided to create midnight solarium, I told myself I would <strong>NOT </strong>create a blog. In my mind, a blog would turn this site into <em>everything I wanted to avoid</em>. Blogs did nothing besides clutter my google search results with barely-relevant lists of products I&rsquo;ll never buy and then demand I pay for a subscription to keep reading. I couldn&rsquo;t envision what they might look like without the trappings of enshittification.</p>
<p>But even without all the business brainrot built on nothing but marketing schemes, does the web really need another person <strong>oversharing</strong> their life? Do I really need to expose myself to strangers? Maybe blogging was just the early stage of the social media panopticon that churns people into boxed-in broadly appealing versions of themselves until they&rsquo;re fit for human consumption.</p>
<p>Then again, I&rsquo;m sure it would be hard to imagine any website existing outside of these constraints if I hadn&rsquo;t <em>seen it with my own eyes</em> &ndash; once as a child, and again now.</p>
<h3>i tricked you! this post is actually web revival propaganda!</h3>
<p>The enshittification of the web is far-reaching, but not universal. You can find countless websites that exist as a labour of love if you know where to look &ndash; and if you&rsquo;ve found this website, you&rsquo;ve definitely found websites like mine but better. I&rsquo;m not gonna bore you by preaching about the Indie Web / Small Web / Web Revival / etcetera movement as a whole. But know that I <strong>adore </strong>that it exists. Not only are there professional developers who take the craft seriously, but also people slapping code together without restraint or apology. I might have a crush on a couple <span data-text="the sites, not the devs"class="tooltip">websites</span>.</p>
<p>And so many of these websites have blogs! Blogs that look entirely different from one another, because it turns out <strong>a blog doesn&rsquo;t have to be any one thing.</strong></p>
<p>My favourites are the ones that feel cohesive with the website as a whole. Fun personal sites might have little updates on the webmaster&rsquo;s experiences, more formal sites might have informative articles, sites themed around media would write reviews, students would share their recent projects &amp; assignments, experimental websites would make their blogs interactive in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>But a blog doesn&rsquo;t have to adhere to some grander purpose for the entire site. A blog can stand entirely on its own, either as a distinct section of a larger website or as the site&rsquo;s sole feature. You can use it to share your journeys, share your creations, share information. It can be as <em>weird </em>or <em>typical </em>as you want. Your posts don&rsquo;t even need to be text-based or presented in any straightforward fashion. The only limits are the ones you choose to impose on it.</p>
<h3>making a blog that works for me</h3>
<p>With all this in mind, I understand why blogging was so popular in the mid-to-late 2000s. All of these niche weblogs are different, but united in that they were nothing like my cynical preconceptions on what a blog has to be.</p>
<p>The truth is clear: my problem isn&rsquo;t with the blog format. I was being held back by my own lack of vision.</p>
<p>Much like the rest of my website, I don&rsquo;t have a specific goal in mind for this weblog. This is mostly a place for me to put anything too insignificant to deserve its own section on the site, so I expect the content here to be pretty discordant. If I feel like sharing something on my mind and it aligns with the type of space I want this site to be, my infodumping has a home here. It&rsquo;s not gonna appeal to a general audience or a single specific niche. Maybe something I say will be interesting to you as well, dear visitor, but if not then please <strong>don&rsquo;t feel pressured to read my weblog</strong>. I clearly have a tendency to ramble.</p>
<p>But at the same time, this site is not me. There&rsquo;s a reason I called this site <strong>midnight solarium</strong> and not my regular username <em>beesilisk</em>. This isn&rsquo;t a knock against anyone who views their site as an extension of themself &ndash; after all, don&rsquo;t we put a bit of ourselves into everything we create? &ndash; but I am an insect who values privacy. I will share parts of myself if I&rsquo;m comfortable doing so, but I want the main attraction to be things I enjoy and things I create. You are not looking at me. You are looking at words I typed.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a silly distinction to worry over, but it&rsquo;s a boundary that&rsquo;ll keep this website fun.</p>
<h3>a meandering diatribe: part [-1]</h3>
<p>As happy as I am to discover a newfound appreciation for blogging, my personal fulfillment doesn&rsquo;t mean much to the internet as a whole. For a long time time, the web has been <strong>taking more from its users than it&apos;s willing to give back</strong>, and corporate greed pretty much guarantees that websites will run themselves to the ground before they give back some of the quality they sacrificed.</p>
<p>People love to discuss the enshittification of social media and propose various solutions, but I don&rsquo;t see as much thought go into preserving blogging. And that&rsquo;s a real shame. Maybe I&rsquo;m just some internet old head clinging to the past, but it feels like a waste to write off a former cornerstone of the web as irrelevant under the social media empire.</p>
<p>I have no solution for the state of mainstream blogging. The Indie Web is, by definition, <strong>niche</strong> and <strong>remote</strong>. This suits hobbyists like me just fine, but it admittedly lacks the ease, accessibility, and reach of modernized platforms. If I wanted to make money, build a professional portfolio, or gain a regular audience, I would not be here.</p>
<p>But for those of us here, I hope we can keep exploring what this supposedly dead medium can bring to our websites. If your site doesn&rsquo;t have one, consider which sort of blog could <em>compliment what you&rsquo;ve already built</em>. If you already have a blog, think about ways you can get <b>weirder</b> with it. If you want to start a blog but don&rsquo;t know where to start, I found <a href="https://zonelets.net/"title="external link to site">Zonelets</a> to be a helpful starting point (I originally intended to use it for this site, but later decided against scripting because I enjoy the hassle).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you should make a blog. Maybe it&rsquo;s for you, maybe it isn&rsquo;t. But don&rsquo;t let yourself be limited by the current state of the web. The internet exists for us. <em>If it doesn&rsquo;t suit our needs, we can create a version that does.</em></p>
